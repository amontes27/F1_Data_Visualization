# Overview
- Filtered, joined, and manipulated the data to generate insights
- Utilized the ggplot2 package to create bar, box, and line plots based on the analysis (see [plots.R](final_project_code/plots.R))
- Designed a poster presentation using the posterdown package to display plots alongside further analysis and background information (see [poster.Rmd](final_project_code/poster/poster.Rmd) and [Data Visualization Final Poster.pdf](Data%20Visualization%20Final%20Poster.pdf))
